Building
--------

First, you need to install Qt5.  
Then, you can either use Qt Creator directly (don't forget to configure your kits/compilers etc.!), or run:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
qmake ..
make
```
##### A special case: iOS with translation (â‰ˆJIT) enabled:

There seems to be a bug in qmake that makes the required .S get ignored when building a JIT-enabled ([`TRANSLATION_ENABLED = true`](https://github.com/nspire-emus/firebird/blob/master/firebird.pro#L4)) binary.  
As a workaround, you'll have to take care of it manually:

1. Hit Build in Qt Creator, on an iOS kit/target. (It'll fail)
2. Open the generated .xcodeproj file (in the build folder) in Xcode
3. Locate `asmcode_arm.S` in the file list, click on it, and in the right sidebar, add it to the Firebird target
4. Adjust any other project settings as you see fit (certs/profiles/team/signings/entitlements/etc. though this should be automatic except the Team choice)
5. Build/Run
